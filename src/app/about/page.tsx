      <p className="text-neutral-400 text-lg">
        I'm Ethan — I started my career in equity research, focused on aerospace and defense, 
        where I built financial models, automated processes, and developed a deep understanding of frontier-tech markets.  
        I’m now shifting from analysis to execution — working on tools and systems with real-world impact.
      </p>

      <p className="text-neutral-400">
        This site is a place to document what I’m building, thinking about, or refining. 
        If you're building in defense, autonomy, or infrastructure — I’d love to connect.
